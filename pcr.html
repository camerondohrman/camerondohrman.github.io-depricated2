                  I am a veritable warehouse superhero. In two weeks over winter
                  break I took on the personal projects of two other
                  supervisors: repairing registers, writing reviews, training
                  new supervisors, and bailing out the food court when they fell
                  behind on pizza orders. With a thank you and a fat handshake
                  from my manager, I left the warehouse to resume my studies.

                  I visited a handful of tables at the WWU All Industries Career
                  Fair. I worked on my elevator pitch in real time, discovering
                  that it is more difficult to make eye contact with HR
                  professionals than it is with myself in the mirror. My attempt
                  to start a friendly rivalry between the oil drilling company
                  and the solar panel company did not seem to entertain either
                  party. Tough crowd.

                  I've always been a little dubious about online social
                  networks, but it has been entertaining and enlightening to see
                  how my classmates and coworkers present themselves online. I
                  even got in touch with an old mentor of mine who I haven't
                  checked in with in many years.

                  As part of the onboarding process for Costco supervisors we
                  take a four hour training course titled "Drawing the Line"
                  which goes over a variety of ethically questionable scenarios
                  and how they can be dealt with in a human and professional
                  manner. The solutions are all common sense, but it is still
                  important to spell it out so that ethical behavior is second
                  nature.

                  huge amount of work into making a space for fifteen of the
                  club members to play a roleplaying game. The club has too many
                  players and too few people organizing games. To help with this
                  problem, I have trained three people in how to run their own
                  games, got them in contact with players, and scheduled times
                  for them to meet. I run a game myself, and I spend about four
                  hours a week organizing and running games for my players.
                  Because I have systems in place for accommodating more
                  players, I can confidently say "Everyone's welcome."

                  Romeo and Jules was a mainstage play put on by the University
                  of Washington while I was a student there. In collaboration
                  with the Trans* advocacy groups on campus, the School of Drama
                  wrote a script following the plot of Shakespeare's Romeo and
                  Juliet but including several non-binary characters and plot
                  conflicts unique to their identity. I played the role of
                  Tybalt, which required a high level of emotional intelligence
                  to do justice to the material. It is the single performance I
                  am most proud of.

                  This course on organizational behavior all led up to a class
                  presentation pitching a new business idea. My idea was a
                  medieval themed family friendly restaurant with a bar and
                  arcade. Not especially original, but the entertaining part was
                  that the management of this fictional company was organized
                  like a feudal dutchy, complete with a Chancellor, Spymaster,
                  Marshal, and Chaplain. We brought costumes and a lot of dark
                  age humor to the presentation. We had the class rolling in
                  laughter, and got straight A's as a bonus.

                  The Professional Women's Association hosted a workshop with a
                  former Enron Financial Officer. It was an extremely
                  interesting opportunity to get the inside story of the famous
                  bankruptcy. She talked about the difficult decisions she had
                  to make as everything fell apart around her. Facing eviction,
                  should she lie to her boss and use the department's cash to
                  pay rent? When she isn't receiving a paycheck, should she
                  continue to show up to work to support her staff? These are
                  interesting questions to ponder, and can help prepare me for
                  the difficult grey area that can occur in the business world.

                  As a supervisor at Costco I was responsible for the annual
                  reviews of a dozen employees. I observed the employee work,
                  talked to them about their methods and habits, and wrote the
                  reviews with the intention of congratulate the person for
                  their efforts while correcting their path towards being a more
                  perfect coworker. This is a tricky line to walk, as the people
                  who most needed course correction were the most likely to take
                  offense to my nudging. The method I liked to use was a "praise
                  sandwich": starting with a sincere compliment, introducing an
                  area that needs improvement, and then ending with a sincere
                  thank you.

                  I am going through the application process to work for Costco
                  corporate, which has included running into the Vice President
                  of Accounting on WWU's campus, getting the approval of my
                  location manager, writing a resume and cover letter, and
                  interviewing with the accounting department. I will hear back
                  from them in just a week now!

                  I am that annoying man who puts his opinions before the City
                  Council! I read an article from Strong Towns called 6 Rules
                  for Actually Changing People's mind and used what I learned to
                  write some carefully worded criticism of city policy which I
                  disagree with. They did not respond, but I consider it a
                  learning opportunity regardless. And now, my grievances are on
                  the permanent public record!
